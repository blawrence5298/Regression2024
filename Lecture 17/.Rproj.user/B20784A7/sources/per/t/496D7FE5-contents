## Lecture 17

```{r}
head(seatpos)
```

```{r}
lm1 <- lm(hipcenter ~ ., data=seatpos)
summary(lm1)
```

```{r}
lm2 <- lm(hipcenter ~ Age + Weight + Ht, data=seatpos)
summary(lm2)
```

Removing some correlated predictors fixes many of the issues caused by multidisciplinary. The predictor $\rm Ht$ is now highly significant in the model. Further simplification is clearly possible.

The $R^2$ of the reduced model with just 3 predictors (Age, Weight, and $\rm Ht$) is close to the $R^2$ of the full model with all the strongly correlated predictors. In fact, the adjusted $R^2$ for the reduced model is slightly higher than the full model.
