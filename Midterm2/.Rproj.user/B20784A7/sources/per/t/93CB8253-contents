## Midterm 2 Practice

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
```

Homework 3:

```{r}
library(ISLR)
head(Auto)
```

1a) Make a scatter plot with mpg on the y-axis, and horsepower on the x-axis

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(Auto, aes(horsepower, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title="title")

ggplotly(p1)
```

1b) Use the lm() function to estimate a second degree polynomial model.

```{r}
lm1 <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 2), data = Auto)
summary(lm1)
```

1c) Use the model to make a prediction and 95% prediction interval for the mpg of a vehicle that has horsepower = 150.

```{r}
predict(lm1, newdata = data.frame(horsepower=150), interval = "prediction")
```

1d) Add the fitted second degree polynomial regression curve to the scatter plot of mpg versus horsepower

```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(Auto, aes(horsepower, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method="lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2)) +
  labs(title="title")

ggplotly(p2)
```

1e) Make a plot of the residuals versus fitted values, and a QQ plot of the standardized residuals. Comment on whether or not there are any violations of the assumptions for regression modeling.

```{r}
p3 <- ggplot(lm1, aes(fitted(lm1), resid(lm1))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0)

p4 <- ggplot(data.frame(Residuals = resid(lm1)), aes(sample = Residuals)) + 
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line(col="red") +
  ggtitle("QQ Plot of Model Residuals")

ggplotly(p3)
ggplotly(p4)
```

The variance appears to not be constant. In addition, the tails of the distribution, according to the QQ plot appear to not follow the normal distribution.

```{r}
head(Carseats)
```

2a) Fit a multiple linear regression model to predict Sales using Price, Urban, and US.

```{r}
lm2 <- lm(Sales ~ Price + factor(Urban) + factor(US), data = Carseats)
summary(lm2)
```

2b) Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Note some of the variables are qualitative.

Intercept: the expected sales when the price is zero, we are not in an Urban area and not in the US is 13, 043 units sold at each location (makes no sense)

Price: holding Urban and US constant, for every one dollar increase in price, we expect Sales to decrease by 54.46 units sold at each location.

Urban: holding Price and US constant, we expect the Sales to decrease by 21.92 units sold at each location if the store is in an urban area.

US: holding Price and Urban constant, we expect the Sales to increase by 1,200.57 units sold at each location if the store is located in the U.S.

2c) Write our equation for the fitted model

$$
\widehat{Sales}=\hat \beta_0+\hat \beta_1Price +\hat \beta_2Urban +\hat \beta_3US
$$

2d) For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis $H_0:\beta_j=0$?

The only predictor that looks insignificant is Urban. With a p-value of 0.936, we fail to reject that $\beta_2=0$.

2e) On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association with the outcome.

```{r}
lm3 <- lm(Sales ~ Price + factor(US), data = Carseats)
summary(lm3)
```

All predictors are now significant

2f) How well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data?

Visually,

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(resid(lm2) ~ fitted(lm2))
abline(h=0, col="red")

qqnorm(rstandard(lm2))
qqline(rstandard(lm2))

#versus

plot(resid(lm3) ~ fitted(lm3))
abline(h=0, col="red")

qqnorm(rstandard(lm3))
qqline(rstandard(lm3))
```

In terms of fit, both models appear good. The residuals appear to have no discernible pattern and the residuals appear to be normal

2g) Using the model from (e), obtain 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients.

```{r}
confint(lm3)
```

Homework 4:

1a) Show that $HH^\prime=HH=H$. That is, $HH^\prime$ is idempotent

Note that

$$
(H^\prime)^\prime=(X(X^\prime X)^{-1}X^\prime)^\prime =X(X^\prime X)^{-1}X^\prime=H
$$

because $(AB)^\prime=B^\prime A^\prime$ and $(ABC)^\prime=((AB)C)^\prime=C^\prime(AB)^\prime=C^\prime B^\prime A^\prime$ and $(A^{-1})^\prime=(A^\prime)^{-1}$

Thus, $H^\prime=H$. In addition,

$$
HH=X(X^\prime X)^{-1}X^\prime X(X^\prime X)^{-1}X^\prime = X(X^\prime X)^{-1}IX^\prime=X(X^\prime X)^{-1}X^\prime=H
$$

2b) Show that $E(\hat Y)=X\beta$

$$
E(\hat Y)=E(X\hat \beta)=XE(\hat \beta)=X\beta
$$

2c) Show that $Var(\hat Y)=\sigma^2H$

$$
\begin{aligned}
Var(\hat Y) &= Var(X\hat \beta) \\
&=Var(X(X^\prime X)^{-1}X^\prime Y) \\
&=X(X^\prime X)^{-1}X^\prime Var(Y)X(X^ \prime X)^{-1}X^\prime \\
&=\sigma^2HH \\
&=\sigma^2H
\end{aligned}
$$
